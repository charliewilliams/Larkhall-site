description: 'Composer and pianist Charlie Hooper-Williams aka Larkhall performs “beautiful” (Times Radio), “soulful, richly layered” (Nick Smithson) music which is “masterfully understated and laced with a magnetic sense of melody” (Archodia). A prizewinning former concert pianist, he combines intricate, virtuosic textures with soaring, stirring melodies. Originally from the pine woods of Minnesota’s Iron Range, he grew up near Chicago, studied at the University of Cambridge Centre for Music and Science, and now makes his home in Bath.'
