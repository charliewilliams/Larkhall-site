Q. Do you always perform with visuals?


{{< details "Not always! For smaller shows or when opening for another artist, it sometimes makes sense to perform solely on piano." >}}
In addition, with the harmonics machine, infinite resonator and effects pedals, I can scale the show up or down to fit any performance situation.

Q. Why do you perform with visuals? What's their function?

{{< details "The visuals allow someone hearing the music for the first time to have the experience of already knowing the piece." >}}
For example, where are the section changes? Which bits are thematically important? How close to the end are we? What kind of a piece is this?

Q. Which comes first, the music or the visuals? Or do they come together?

{{< details "Fundamentally, I am a musician first and foremost. So generally I have a musical idea, and then think about how visuals could support it." >}}
As my visuals explorations have matured, I have started to have visual ideas that don't yet have a musical counterpart. I am always thinking about what music could be well-supported by those visuals and I'm sure that we'll start to see pieces inspired by visual explorations in the coming months.
