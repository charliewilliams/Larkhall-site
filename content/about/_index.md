Larkhall is the performance alias of Charlie Williams, a composer, pianist, and creative coder who combines piano, visual art, and technology to create moving, cinematic performances.

His AI system 'Otto' creates visuals that unfold in time with the structure of each composition, reacting in real time to the individual nuance of each performance, resulting in a unique and immersive experience.

Williams largely taught himself to play the piano and went on to win the prize for new music performance at the International Shostakovich Piano Competition. He also worked as a software developer for tech startups including Shazam, where he built an audio-reactive "listening" animation.

His 2019 album, *The Sea Was Never Blue*, hit #2 on the UK iTunes Classical Chart and introduced his signature style of musically-reactive visuals. The 2022 followup, *Say You're With Me*, earned him praise as "A new exciting voice on the contemporary scene" by Hannah MacInnes of Times Radio and "Absolutely lovely" by Scala Radio.

In 2023, he is set to release an album of reworks from *Say You're With Me*, which has already received praise from BBC Introducing, Archodia, Black Cat Radio, Drivelcast, and LiveWire Music.

Don't miss the chance to experience Larkhall's unique blend of music and technology in his [upcoming performances](/concerts).
