Alongside performances, I frequently run **"Intro to Creative Coding"** and **"Creating Live Visuals for Music Performance"** workshops where young people and adults can have a first taste of using free software to create live reactive visuals, without having to write a line of code.

**Workshop Format 1**

_This format is suitable for anyone comfortable with basic computer skills, i.e. opening and saving files, typing, and using a mouse/trackpad._ 
- Students work in pairs, using one laptop for each pair of participants.
- The workshop is very hands-on and participatory, with plenty of scope for questions and safe trial-and-error.
- In the main part of the workshop, we build an audio-reactive animated multifaceted shape with dynamic lighting and movement.
- In the closing period, participants can work independently, ask questions, and get help on specific ideas they want to implement. 
- Sometimes this leads to more group discussion of a topic of interest to the group.
- Participants can export a video file of their own personal creation to email to themselves, and can also take a copy of their project file to continue working on at home.
- They leave with a list of resources for further exploration.

**Workshop Format 2**

_An alternate version of the workshop for younger participants, SEND students, or anyone else interested in creating collaboratively. Computer skills are not required. Please get in touch to discuss your prospective audience's specific needs._

- As a group, we walk through creating the same scene as above. The instructor uses the software, explaining what's happening and soliciting ideas and feedback from the participants.
- Participants make suggestions about how the shape should look and move, colour and placement of lights, how the scene should react to audio.
- Volunteers can sing, clap or make noise and see the scene react to their sound.
- The end result is available as an image, video file and project file for participants who want to work with it further at home or share with friends.

**Philosophy**

These workshops take a hands-on, dive-right-in approach to creative coding. From the very beginning, participants learn by doing, making [simple, visual, interactive scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PYaiNqd9DI) right away. Using the same [software](https://derivative.ca/) I use for my own live visuals, you'll make things spin, glow, warp, and sparkle as you learn about rendering, lighting, textures and more. 


**Workshop Leader**

Charlie Hooper-Williams is an award-winning composer, pianist and
one of the software developers of the global top-10 app Shazam. His
performances as Larkhall combine piano with live-generated reactive
visuals, posing the question: **What if you could see music?** Having
achieved 250k streams, radio play on BBC Radio 3, Scala, Times
Radio as well as editorial support from Apple Music and Pandora,
Larkhall’s “vividly beautiful” “music to soothe the soul” is “unmissable… a must-see show”.

**Outcomes**
- Finished audio-reactive scene (as shown at the top of this page)
which can be exported and shared
- Increased understanding of software engineering in a live context
- Confidence in picking up new technical skills
- Experience with digital storytelling

Otto is the name for my live visuals system. Because it listens and responds as I play, it feels more like playing with another person than following along to a machine; hence giving Otto a name. Otto's listening system is built in [Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max) using modules from IRCAM's [Antescofo](https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/antescofo) project.

Otto and I create the visuals during my performances in [Touchdesigner](https://derivative.ca), which is a programming system built specifically for this purpose.

In recordings and live performances I use some effects pedals on the piano. 

First we have a tape delay simulator: the [Strymon El Capistan](https://www.strymon.net/), which gives a lovely warm analogue-sounding trail or echo on the piano sound.

From there we go into the [Microcosm by Hologram Electronics](https://www.hologramelectronics.com/microcosm). This brilliant pedal chops up the sound into thousands of small fragments each second, and uses those to make a granular cloud around the piano's sound. It intelligently adapts based on what I'm playing. If you hear the sound of a distant orchestra accompanying me while I play, it's probably this pedal.

Finally I use the [Strymon Big Sky](https://www.strymon.net/), which is one of the most powerful and flexible reverbs I've ever heard. It has shimmer and cloud effects that give an otherworldly, spacious sound to the piano.
