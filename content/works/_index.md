title: 'Larkhall | Works'
description: 'Intensely delicate and intimate, this composition distills the emotional essence of a piece which has moved audiences to tears in live performance. Embedding the pianoâ€™s acoustic sound in a gentle forest of atmospheric whispers, in turns hopeful and despairing, its crystalline top line floating above a flurry of inner voices.'
