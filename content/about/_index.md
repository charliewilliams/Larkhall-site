Audience reviews:
“⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. You won’t be disappointed if you take time out of frantic festival schedule to go to see Larkhall. Visually stunning. Musically sublime.”
Ceri Morgan

“Larkhall's Say You're With Me at Summerhall is an elegant chamber set of (mostly) piano music with enchanting, live-generated visuals from a computer onstage next to the performer. The graphics for each song look quite different, but are all intimately connected to the music.”
Asa Wember

“10 Ed Fest Best: A breathtaking experience as live piano combines with algorithmic visual representations of the music. My definite blind discovery of the Fringe.”
